# The History of Beyond The Horizon

Long ago, the **Overworld** was home to ancient beings whose knowledge and power surpassed imagination. They grew magnificent organic towers that reached for the skies, serving as hubs in their advanced travel network. The towers allowed them to teleport great distances, standing as symbols of their wisdom and mastery over the natural world. But one day, without warning, these ancient beings vanished, leaving their creations behind‚Äîenigmatic monuments to a forgotten age.

Centuries passed in their absence. Adventurers, traders, and settlers from every dimension came to call this land home, starting a new age of progress and prosperity. People from the Aether brought their celestial wonders, while the creatures of the Nether brought fire and magic. Even the cunning rats from Ratlantis emerged, fascinated by the Overworld‚Äôs technology. The rats were hungry for innovation, exchanging their precious coins for machines and tools, spreading their currency far and wide, and economies formed. Rumors still linger that deep within Ratlantis lie untold riches‚Äîwonders of technology hidden in their coffers, waiting for a daring explorer to claim them.

Prosperity was fleeting. Tensions between the **Aether** and the **Nether** boiled over into a devastating war, with the Overworld caught in the middle. Great battles raged across the land, and scars of conflict remain etched into its soil‚Äîabandoned fortresses, shattered weapons, and remnants of long-forgotten battlefields. The towers of the ancients, once symbols of unity and progress, became silent witnesses to this era of turmoil.

Now, the future of the Overworld lies in your hands. The land is alive with opportunities for discovery and adventure: uncover the secrets of the ancients, scour Ratlantis for technological marvels, and explore the battlefields of the past in search of lost treasure. Wherever you roam, a Quest Book is available to guide you, offering tips and direction when needed.

In¬†**Beyond The Horizon**, your path is yours to choose. Will you develop technology, harness the mystical power of magic, or embrace a nomadic lifestyle, traveling on horse or dragonback through a beautiful world full of history, lost riches, and potential? Adventure is waiting‚Äîwhat will you find just beyond the horizon?

# About

Beyond The Horizon (BTH) features a thoughtful selection of mods, all tested, customized and integrated to overhaul many aspects of Minecraft. It provides a fresh and immersive experience centered on exploration enhanced by technology and magic. Here are some of the highlights:

***

**‚òÄÔ∏è Distant Horizons**

True to its name, BTH is designed around [**Distant Horizons**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/distant-horizons) and its game-changing render distances of several hundred chunks. Structures and villages are spaced farther apart to account for this, making mounts, vehicles and other travel methods central to the modpack.

You can scout for interesting structures and terrain from hundreds of blocks away and set out on an exciting journey‚Äîall with minimal impact on performance!

***

**üèîÔ∏è World Generation**

With [**Tectonic**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tectonic) handling terrain generation for the Overworld, the world features massive mountain ranges, deep oceans, and an increased build height limit to 640 blocks. Complemented by mods like [**Terralith**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/terralith), BTH offers diverse biomes to explore and build upon.

In addition to the Overworld, Nether, and End, this modpack includes [**Ratlantis**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/rats) and [**The Aether**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/aether) as extra dimensions. All dimensions have been heavily customized to suit the modpack's style and work beautifully with **Distant Horizons**.

üè∞¬†**Structures**

BTH boasts a rich variety of high-quality structures across all dimensions, thanks to mods like [**Integrated Dungeons and Structures**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/idas), **Yung's Better series**, and village mods such as [**ChoiceTheorem's Overhauled Village**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/choicetheorems-overhauled-village), [**Luki's Grand Capitals**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lukis-grand-capitals), and [**Towns and Towers**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/towns-and-towers).

**‚úàÔ∏è Exploration**

To complement the greater view distance and revamped world generation, we've included a variety of travel-focused mods, from upgraded horses to advanced land, water, and air vehicles.

[**End Remastered**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/endremastered) eyes needed to open the End portal can be found in structures spread across different biomes. Furthermore, some of the more powerful items in the game, like **Drygmys** and **air vehicles**, have custom recipes that require exploration. **Maps** to interesting biomes and treasure can be found in structures or by fishing. This all culminates in an addicting gameplay loop of traveling, looting and upgrading.¬†

ü•´¬†**Food and Health**

Chefs and farmers will feel right at home in BTH! A new food system makes farming, cooking and prepping for adventure a lot more rewarding. Thanks to the mod [**Spice of Life: Valheim Updated**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/spice-of-life-valheim-updated), eating food now grants a buff of health and speed. Better food means longer-lasting and stronger effects.

To make the most of this new system, [**Farmer‚Äôs Delight**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/farmers-delight) and its addons introduce new ingredients, recipes and cooking utensils. You can also more easily automate cooking with Create: Slice and Dice. You can also increase your base hearts by completing advancements‚Äîcheck the in-game Quest Book for details.

**üìü Technology**

BTH offers a hand-picked selection of technology mods, including [**Immersive Engineering**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immersive-engineering), [**EnderIO**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ender-io), [**PneumaticCraft**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/pneumaticcraft-repressurized), [**Create**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create) and more.

The most industrious engineers can automate the generation of various valuable resources, as well as craft incredibly powerful tools, weapons and armor, giving them control over land, sea and sky.

Magic is a powerful tool in combat and exploration, allowing you to deal damage, heal yourself and others, summon powerful allies, traverse the land and skies, and even teleport across vast distances. With a bit of creativity, magic can also be used to automate various tasks, from everyday chores to world-shaping feats.¬†

**‚öîÔ∏è Combat**

With [I**mmersive Armors**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immersive-armors) and [**Simply Swords**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simply-swords), you‚Äôll find diverse sets of weapons and armor that are not only visually impressive but also incredibly powerful.

**ü§ù Multiplayer**

Adventuring with friends is always more fun! While BTH works great in singleplayer, it was designed with multiplayer in mind. Impress your friends with stunning photos taken using the [**Exposure**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/exposure) mod, paint on a canvas with [**Joy of Painting**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/joy-of-painting), or form a band using [**Music Maker Mod**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/music-maker-mod) and [**Etched**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/etched). You can even mail your artwork or anything else to other players with [**Mighty Mail**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mighty-mail).

Want to focus on adventuring rather than farming? Gather coins in your travels and trade resources with your friends using [**Lightman‚Äôs Currency**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lightmans-currency). We configured the economy in the modpack to make it immersive and guarantee its viability. All players start with a wallet and currency is based on coins which can be earned by exploring‚Äîthe further away you are from the center of the world, the more coins you find in loot. With enough coins, you can open a portal to Ratlantis where you can find high tech loot brought there from the overworld by the rats.

Don‚Äôt have friends to play multiplayer with? You can always make your own friends with [**MineColonies**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/minecolonies)!

# FAQ

**Q: What can I do in this modpack? Is there an end goal?**

A: This is a sandbox modpack aimed at improving exploration in every aspect. There is no specific end goal, but if you‚Äôre feeling lost, check out the in-game Quest Book or the Advancements menu for inspiration. We have created some custom end-game items to reward players who progress in multiple mods, including Terminus (a sword for experienced interdimensional travelers) and NanoBot Soda (a food item with hours worth of health and speed buffs). There is also the unique and fun Plushie Challenge that is bound to keep you busy for many hours.

**Q: Where is my hunger bar? Why do I start with 3 hearts? How do I get more?**

A: BTH uses the mod [**Spice of Life: Valheim Updated**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/spice-of-life-valheim-updated) to improve the hunger system and make it more rewarding to cook and eat interesting foods. If you‚Äôve eaten no foods, you‚Äôll be at your base hearts (3 at start), but any food you eat grants a buff of health and speed. Better food means longer-lasting and stronger buffs. You can also permanently increase your base hearts by completing advancements‚Äîcheck the in-game Quest Book for details.

**Q: How can I reduce server lag?**

A: We highly recommend pre-generating chunks with **Distant Horizons** or **Chunky**, for both servers and singleplayer worlds. A big cause of lag is generation of new chunks when players travel through new regions. By pre-generating, the chunks loads smoothly even when traveling at fast speeds. A good world size to pre-generate that will include most biomes and rare structures is about 512 chunks radius, or 8192 blocks for the overworld. For other dimensions half of that should be plenty. A fully pre-generated overworld will take up around 20GB of disk space, including region files and Distant Horizons LOD data. We recommend using the command "/dh pregen" since that will generate both world chunks and LOD data.

**Q: Why aren‚Äôt monsters spawning at night?**

A: To make early-game travel easier, the [**PeacefulSurface**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/peacefulsurface) mod prevents select mobs from spawning on the Overworld‚Äôs surface during regular nights. Endermen, illagers and phantoms will still spawn as usual, and monsters can still appear anywhere not directly exposed to the sky. Every few nights, a blood moon will rise, which can‚Äôt be skipped. During blood moons, all kinds of monsters will spawn on the surface at a significantly higher rate. Campfires also keep monsters away so bring one when you go camping.

**Q: What is Distant Horizons?**

A: Distant Horizons (DH) is a Minecraft mod that extends the view distance of the game by rendering faraway terrain in a simplified, low-detail format often referred to as LODs (Level Of Detail). This allows players to see far beyond the normal render distance limit of Minecraft, making for stunning visuals and improving the scale of the world without sacrificing performance.

DH included in this pack is the experimental release with multiplayer support which can be downloaded from their Gitlab page. When playing on a server, the server will generate the LOD data in addition to the chunk data and send to the clients. If you prefer to use the older, possibly more stable version without multiplayer support it can be downloaded from¬†[CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/distant-horizons).

By default DH generation mode is set to "Internal Server" which means that DH will generate and keep the world chunks, in addition to LOD data.¬† Effectively this means DH has the same capabilities as Chunky for pre-generating chunks. One can use the command "/dh pregen" on a server to generate chunks and LOD data in one pass.

**Q: How can I increase my FPS?**

A: When first joining a new world Distant Horizons will work hard to generate chunks and LOD data around the player and this can have an impact on performance. It usually gets better after 30-60 minutes of gameplay. If not, try reducing the CPU load in DH settings. Otherwise, it depends on what exactly is causing your FPS to decrease. Here are some things you can try:

*   Reduce shader quality
*   Disable shader shadows
*   Reduce vanilla render distance
*   Reduce Distant Horizons render distance and/or quality
*   Disable shaders
*   As a last resort, disable Distant Horizons (the modpack is still totally playable without Distant Horizons!)

If nothing seems to work, try asking for help in our Discord.

**Q: Why doesn‚Äôt my chunkloader work when I‚Äôm offline?**

A: BTH is designed to be as server and lag friendly as possible. Therefore chunkloaders only forceload chunks when the player who owns the chunkloader is online.¬†
